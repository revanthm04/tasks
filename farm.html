        <p><span>üèòÔ∏è Indian Farm house: </span> An Indian farmhouse, or kothi, traditionally served as the primary residence on an agricultural estate, 
            deeply rooted in the country's agrarian culture. Today, while still connected to farmland, the concept has evolved, especially for urban 
            dwellers. It is an escape from the city's chaos‚Äîa second home or weekend retreat nestled amidst large plots of land, often featuring lush 
            landscaping, gardens, and sometimes actual farming activities. Contemporary farmhouses blend rustic charm with modern amenities, offering 
            a spacious, private, and nature-centric lifestyle. They typically adhere to local zoning rules, which often restrict construction to a 
            small percentage (around 10-15%) of the total plot area to preserve the open, green space.</p>

            <p><span>‚è≥ History and Importance :</span>
                Historically, the Indian farmhouse was integral to farming life, providing shelter, storage, and a central point for managing 
                agricultural activities. Its design was utilitarian, focusing on local materials like mud, stone, or wood. As India's economy 
                urbanized, the farmhouse gained new significance. It transitioned from a necessity for an agriculturist to a lifestyle statement 
                and a smart investment for the affluent city resident. Its modern importance lies in providing wellness‚Äîclean air, natural surroundings, 
                and space for family bonding away from urban stress. The resurgence of interest in farmhouses reflects a desire for sustainable living, 
                a connection to nature, and an appreciation for vast, private open spaces, which are increasingly scarce in metropolitan areas.</p>

            <p><span>üí∞ Cost to Build or Buy : </span>The cost to build or buy an Indian farmhouse varies widely, depending heavily on location, land size, 
                and the level of luxury/construction. Land prices near major cities like Bangalore, Mumbai, or Delhi can be significantly high. Farmhouse 
                plots (often a minimum of one acre or more, varying by state regulation) can range from a few lakhs to several crores of Indian Rupees, as 
                exemplified by plots near certain developments starting in the $\text{‚Çπ}50 \text{ to } \text{‚Çπ}60 \text{ lakh}$ range for a quarter acre. 
                Construction costs can also range dramatically. A basic, simple cottage-style structure might cost less, while a luxurious, fully-equipped 
                modern farmhouse with a swimming pool and high-end finishes could entail a multi-crore investment. For a ballpark, simple construction 
                might be $\text{‚Çπ}1,500$ to $\text{‚Çπ}3,000$ per square foot, but luxury builds are much higher. It's crucial to factor in hidden expenses 
                like maintenance, security, and the ongoing cost of managing the farmland.
