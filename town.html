        <p><span>üèòÔ∏è Indian Townhouses: Blending Tradition with Modern Urban Living</span> Indian townhouses, often interchangeably referred 
            to as row houses in modern real estate, represent a popular residential model that efficiently blends the feel of an independent 
            house with the conveniences of community living. Distinct from the historical, ornate haveli, these structures are typically 
            multi-story units that share one or two side walls with adjacent homes, forming a continuous row. Each unit maintains its own 
            private entrance and, often, a small, private outdoor space like a front porch, balcony, or a compact backyard. This vertical 
            living arrangement is an efficient use of land, which makes it particularly prevalent in densely populated urban and suburban 
            areas of India. The design, while often featuring a uniform facade to maintain community cohesion, allows for internal customisation, 
            providing a desirable balance of community proximity and individual ownership.</p>

            <p><span>‚è≥ History and Importance in the Urban Landscape :</span>
                The concept of connected dwellings in a row, with shared walls for land efficiency, has its roots in traditional urban planning 
                across India, though the modern townhouse format has been heavily influenced by global real estate trends. In the contemporary 
                Indian context, townhouses have gained importance as a middle ground between crowded apartment flats and expensive, detached 
                villas. Historically, they solved the need for high-density housing for the working and middle class in industrialising cities, 
                an early example being the chawls of Mumbai, which were multi-unit, row-like buildings designed for community living. Today, 
                townhouses are vital as they offer a sense of privacy and a multi-floor lifestyle that is similar to a detached home, but at a 
                more accessible price point in costly metropolitan areas. They help foster a close-knit community atmosphere, as units are closely 
                situated, and are frequently part of gated developments that offer shared amenities and enhanced security.</p>

            <p><span>üí∞ Cost to Build or Buy an Indian Townhouse : </span>The cost to acquire or construct a townhouse in India is highly variable, 
                depending on the city, location, size, and quality of materials. Buying a completed townhouse will include the cost of the land, 
                construction, builder's profit, and associated legal fees (stamp duty, registration). In major metropolitan areas (Tier-1 cities), 
                the cost to buy a new townhouse or 'row house' unit can be substantial, often ranging from ‚Çπ75 Lakhs to well over ‚Çπ3 Crore depending 
                on the locality and size. If you were to build a comparable home yourself (excluding the land cost), general residential construction 
                costs currently average between ‚Çπ1,500 to ‚Çπ3,500 per square foot of built-up area, with premium finishes pushing this rate higher. 
                Therefore, a modest 1,500 sq. ft. built-up area townhouse could have a construction cost alone ranging from approximately ‚Çπ22.5 Lakhs 
                to over ‚Çπ52.5 Lakhs, not factoring in the significant expense of the land itself.
